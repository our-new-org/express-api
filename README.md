## Getting Started

To use this template to start a new project, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Use this template" button at the top of this repository.
2. Choose a name for your new repository based on this template.
3. Clone your newly created repository to your local machine.
4. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # then
   npm run dev
   ```


## ESLint Configuration

This template comes pre-configured with ESLint and the mentioned ESLint plugins to maintain code quality. 
You can customize the ESLint rules by editing the `.eslintrc.json` configuration files.


## Prettier Configuration

This template includes a `.prettierrc.json` configuration file to help maintain code formatting consistency. However, Prettier is not a direct project dependency to avoid conflicts with ESLint plugins.
Developers working on the project may choose to use Prettier within their code editors or development environments. If you decide to use Prettier, it is recommended to configure it to match the ESLint rules and recommendations used in this template.

To customize or disable specific Prettier rules to align with ESLint rules:
Add or adjust rules in the `.prettierrc.json` file as needed. You can use this file to override or disable Prettier rules that may conflict with ESLint.

Example `.prettierrc.json`:

```json
{
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true,
  // Add more Prettier rules as needed
}
```

By doing this, you can ensure that your code formatting remains consistent with the ESLint rules while giving developers the flexibility to configure Prettier to their preferences.
Remember that Prettier settings are subjective, so individual developers can tailor them to their liking while respecting the project's ESLint rules and guidelines.
